When you see a problem says "write a PROGRAM" that means when you run it, it does whatever the task asks.

When you see a problem that says "write a FUNCTION", that means you only execute this IF the problem CALLS the function.

When you finish, commit all your changes to Github.  You can use cloud 09 if you want, but it is not neccessary.
